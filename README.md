# QA_Automation_Project

We are using Selenium, TestNG for Reporting, Java as a language to automate and Maven to manage all the dependencies throughout the project, all of these resources are open source.


This is Hybrid framework using properties of "Page Object Model" and "Data Driven" frameworks.


This is the Package Representation of our Automation Framework:

1. PageObjects : This package will contain classes representing each page which need to be automated.

2. Helpers : This package will contain all the Helper classes which can be used throughout the automation project.

3. Tests : This package will contain all the test scripts(test cases) which we need to automate in different classes.
